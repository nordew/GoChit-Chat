# GoChit-Chat

GoChit-Chat is a simple chat application built in Go using microservice architecture and websockets.

## Overview

This project consists of three main services:

1. **UserService**:
    - Utilizes gRPC as transport.
    - PostgreSQL as the database.
    - JWT Tokens for authorization.

2. **Chat**:
    - Provides rooms and the ability to join them.
    - Uses gin + websockets for transport.
    - PostgreSQL as the database.

3. **Gateway**:
    - Offers an API Gateway to all services based on gRPC.
    - Utilizes Fiber as the router.

Each service has its own Dockerfile, configuration, and migrations, and they are built using a unified Docker Compose file.
